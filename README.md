# Project Instructions
Follow the instructions here: https://vuxcode.netlify.app/new/pr1/lessons/major-project-brief/

REMEMBER TO "COMMIT" YOUR CHANGES REGULARLY TO SHOW HOW YOU HAVE BUILT THIS PROJECT! 

The final program is not the goal! The aim of the project is to show how you have developed your program, the steps you have taken and the problems you have solved!

# Project Notes

> You can use this section of the file to keep notes about your project as you work on it.

# Project Summary

> What I have written is a basic card-game program, in which one player can play a simplified version of blackjack against the computer program.

> When it comes to my experience of the project, I will admit I don't remember much of the process itself. I can however say without a doubt that I was really smart of me to go to so many of the workshops, since I would not have had the needed motivation to finish it without a teacher hanging over my shoulder. I can also say that I have found a preference for JS compared to HTML.

> If I had the time, I would actually have liked to add Ace card supervalues. By this I mean, I wish the playing parties could, in the case of drawing a ace, be able to chose to value it at 10 or 1, like one can in actual blackjack. I could also have integrated some HTML/CSS code to make the program more visually interesting (note that I say "could", since I wouldn't actually want to do that).

> When it comes to the budget, I don't really know. Since I didn't write in the time-report more than once and I don't remember much of the process, I can't rightly say if I remained within the time budget. Though if I was forced to guess, I would guess that I remained inside it. Still, that's just a guess. 

# User Guide

> Write a clear user guide for how someone should use your program.
