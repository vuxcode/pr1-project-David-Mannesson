1. Problem: I want one button to run both the function which adds numbers to the points as well as the function which updates the screen.
 - Solution1.1: Add semicolons [failure]
 - Solution1.2: Integrate both functions into one overarching function [failure]
 - Solution1.3: Start drinking [Awaiting approval...]

2. Problem: I want to be able to replace a string of text at the click of a button using a function. Said function is supposed to replace a string of text with an empty string if the variable contains a specific message and vice versa, but it refuses to work.
 - Solution2.1: Just doing it [failure]
 - Solution2.2: see Solution1.3
